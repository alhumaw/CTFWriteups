# Garden

# Description
This garden contains more than it seems.

# Approach
The main point of this challenge was to learn how to use hex tools like xxd. 
The xxd command allows you to create a hex dump from a file. 
In other words, you get basically the same output as with hexedit, but xxd only displays the output.

In my case, I utilized a hex editor: bless ("bless garden.jpg"). By viewing the hexdump of the file, we find the flag
